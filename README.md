# Quran SRS

## Intro

### One-line summary
An attempt to use the concept of Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to make the memorization and revision of Quran easier. 

### How will it benefit me?
1. Rather than doing a revision of a fixed number of pages (say 20, 40, or 60 pages) per day, you can bring down the number of pages
2. You can focus more time on the difficult parts and less time on the easy parts - thus helping you to improve your memorization
3. Systematic revision forces you to stay on track and not lose the memorized pages completely (assuming you do at least a few pages suggested by the algorithm)
